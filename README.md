## A list of all the non-remote-friendly tech companies exploiting remote job options for their employees.

## Why have we created this?

We believe that work life balance is a must for all the employees irrespective of any domain,culture or country.
But there are some tech companies who are exploiting their remote employees in different ways like forcing them to adapt a 12 hour work-week schedule which is hazardous for employees' health. Also, there are some companies who do not believe in providing remote working flexibility to their employees during tough times (e.g COVID-19 outbreak).

So, we decided to build a list to shame all of those companies.
